                    In this game, players take on the roles of characters located within a virtual dungeon. Player avatars are situated in the lower-left corner of the interface, while the dungeon master's presence is in the upper-right corner. As the game begins, the first player is presented with a question initiated by the dungeon master.
                </p>   
                <p>Players' responses are based on the 'spells' they've acquired as they progress through the leveling system. For example, if the dungeon master presents a question related to brainstorming, players must select an appropriate 'spell' from their arsenal to respond. Correct answers enable the game to advance to the next player's turn, while an incorrect response results in the entire group losing health.</p>

                <p>During the planning phase, the initial concept was to allow players to select a specific category to focus on within the game. However, as the development process evolved, it became more logical to grant players access to all categories available for their character.
                </p>
                <p>This approach ensures that the player's level and accumulated knowledge are significant factors during the dueling encounters.</p>

                <p>This image illustrates the concept of how gameplay would function. In this scenario, 'User 1' assumes the role of the question asker. The questions presented are derived from the spells they've acquired through leveling up. As the player, you occupy the bottom left corner, where you can select answers from the list of acquired spells to respond to the questions.</p>

The game round initiates with the player on the far left and progresses to the next player once they have provided their response.</p>
