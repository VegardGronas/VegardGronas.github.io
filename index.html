            <div>
                <p>
                    In this game, players within the dungeon are represented by images positioned in the lower left corner, while the dungeon master resides in the upper right corner. When the game commences, the first player is presented with a question from the dungeon master. The player's response hinges on the spells they've acquired through the level system. For instance, if the dungeon master poses a question related to brainstorming, the player must choose from their acquired spells to provide an answer. If the response is correct, the game proceeds to the next player. However, an incorrect answer results in the entire group losing health.

            <div>
                <p>During planning the idea was that players could select a category they world focus on. However, after working more it made more sense to allow every category that the players have available to their character, so that the level difference and knowledge learned would be of value druing the duel.</p>

                <p>This image illustrate the idea of how the  gameplay would work. "User 1" are in this case the one asking a question. The question are from the spells they have aquired through leveling. In the left lower corner "you" as the player can select answers for the question from the list of aquired spells.</p>

                <p>This last image show how a dungeon would work, here there are a group of 5 peers that follow the same gameplay as it would be to challange eachother. Howeveer, now the questions are asked by a AI or premade dugeonmaster.<br><br> The round start with the most left player, and advances to the next after they have answered.</p>
